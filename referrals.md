# Referrals

Like most people, I rely on various companies to provide services which make my life easier in one way or another. Some are necessities, while others are for fun. Below is a selection of referral links to those who I feel do a good job, and are worth singing the praises of. In most cases, if you use my link/code, one, other, or both of us will receive a bonus of some sort.
